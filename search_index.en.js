What is the difference between the two and why would I choose to put aliases in one and not the other?\nAnswer: .bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.\n\nWhen you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.\nBut, if you’ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc also runs when you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.\nOn OS X, Terminal by default runs a login shell every time, so this is a little different to most other systems, but you can configure that in the preferences.\nSource: apple.stackexchange.com\n","id":"https://kingnand.blog/what-is-the-difference-between-bash-profile-and-bashrc/","title":"What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?"}},"docInfo":{"https://kingnand.blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://kingnand.blog/about/":{"body":64,"title":0},"https://kingnand.blog/basic-linux-commands/":{"body":294,"title":3},"https://kingnand.blog/contact/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://kingnand.blog/init/":{"body":130,"title":2},"https://kingnand.blog/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://kingnand.blog/postgresql-tools-things-you-need-to-monitor-or-tuning/":{"body":142,"title":6},"https://kingnand.blog/what-is-the-difference-between-bash-profile-and-bashrc/":{"body":86,"title":4}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
